# Jump

iOS library for integrating Leap Motion gestures into an app.

[See it in action on ChallengePost!](http://challengepost.com/software/jump)

Depends on [JumpApp](https://github.com/Shrugs/JumpApp) to proxy Leap websocket server over Bonjour-enabled socket to iOS client.

Has a massive memory leak, please do not use seriously yet.
